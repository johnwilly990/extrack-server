## API Endpoints

NOTE: All enpoints except `/api/signup` and `/api/login` require `Authorization: Bearer token` sent as `headers`

NOTE: 0 values will only be for new users. Users that are already in the database will have values they've already inputted

### Error Messages

All errors -- user generated or otherwise -- should return an error response in the following format:

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Your appropriate message goes here"

```

- `status`: returns the appropriate HTTP status starting with 4xx or 5xx
- `message`: an appropriate error message

### Response codes

- 200 - OK: Everything worked as expected.
- 201 - Created: A new resource was created.
- 400 - Bad Request: The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
- 500 - Server Error: Server encountered something it didn't expect; unable to complete the request.

## Lessons learned

- Database management can get real tricky
- Usage of middlewares are critical for clean and readable code

## Next Steps

- Make schemas for invesments and savings
- Make schemas for each category of both recurring and flexible expenses so that users can get more data based on category
- Clean up code; make use of more middlewares
